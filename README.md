A Safe Way Of Downloading Youtube Videos

This app is created by A Solo Developer Aarif Ahmed.

System Requirements for running the Source Code:

If you don't have python installed go to https://github.com/AarifAhmed/Youtube-Video-Downloader/releases and download the 'Youtube_Video_Downloader.zip' and extract it. 
Note: Don't drag and drop the exe file. Instead create a shortcut and place it where you want the exe to be.

The app may stop responding when downloading the videos. Wait patiently until the app says download completed.
